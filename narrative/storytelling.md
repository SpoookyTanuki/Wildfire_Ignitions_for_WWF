**Ignitions from Power Lines in Greece**

By Elena Palenova with collaboration with WWF Greece

**Background**

Sparks from power lines are a recognised source of wildfires around the world. Between 2016 and 2020, 10% of incidents and 19% of burned areas in California  [were caused](https://information.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf)  by the power lines, with  [an estimated cost](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/7/12/442)  of \$11.03 bln in direct annual losses-including property damage, suppression, and post-fire restoration-and additional massive indirect costs that are hard to quantify.

The number of catastrophic events that have happened due to power lines in many fire-prone areas, including Greece, remains underexplored. According to WWF Greece's estimations, ignitions from power lines are linked to some of the most devastating fires in Greece.

**Among them:**

- Parnitha in 2007 (200 km²)
- Faraklo in Laconia in 2015 (200 km²)
- Chios in 2016 (180 km²)
- Eastern Mani in 2017 (80 km²)
- Gerania Mountains in 2018 (250 km²)
- Tatoi in 2021 (300 km²)
- Eastern Attica in 2024 (420 km²)

In 2025, electricity network caused 55% of all burned areas in Greece - 6 to 10 fires, more than 1,000 hectares burned

Incidents occur due to:

- **Inadequate maintenance** and limited inspections of the network leave faults undetected
- Poor **vegetation clearance** allows branches to touch or fall onto power lines and construction of concrete bases on the poles
- **Corrosion,** such as oxidized cables and rusted clamps, weakens connections and raises the chance of sparks
- **Sagging wires** can droop under heat or strain and reach ground vegetation
- **Damaged insulators,** cracks, wear in insulation, and gaps in proper insulation in high-risk areas can lead to electrical faults and sparks
- **Weakened poles and hardware,** aging poles or fittings, may collapse in strong winds, dropping wires on the ground
- **Cost saving** leads to poor quality of replacement parts
- **Construction of the underground network** is slow
- **Birds** can collide with the power line and be electrocuted

Approximately 90% of medium- and low-voltage lines in Greece are **above ground**, making them vulnerable to extreme weather. **Climate change pressures increase**: hotter, drier, and windier conditions amplify risks from systemic infrastructure weaknesses.

**There is no systematic research** on sources, characteristics, or the share of fires caused by power lines in Greece.

Official public data regarding ignition sources from the Hellenic Fire Service, the official country's authority responsible for fire suppression, remains limited. NGOs and volunteers provide partial information, but comprehensive public records are missing.

**Our aim** is to assess the availability of official and non-official data and explore retrieving historical evidence of electricity-induced fires using GIS & remote sensing and practitioner interviews.

**Ignition Investigations**

The Hellenic Fire Service provided data on 40,842 investigated cases of wildfire ignition sources, including **736 cases linked to electricity,** covering the period 2000-2023. This dataset is not publicly available and was obtained by WWF Greece through a private request.

We mapped the electricity-induced cases across municipalities to identify areas with a higher frequency of wildfires that occurred due to electrical ignitions.

Electricity ignitions per municipalities, 2000-2023

Among causes of fires investigated by the Fire Service, these **municipalities have the highest number of fires** caused by electricity ignitions:

Fire in Ampelia village, Agrinio municipality, July 2023

- Karystos: 29
- Monemvasia: 29
- Lavreotiki: 24
- Kymi-Aliveri: 23
- Rhodes: 19
- Ermionida: 16
- Kassandra: 16
- Chalkida: 14

WWF Greece noted that the information confirmed practical experience and was **fully consistent with field knowledge**.

However, according to the NGO calculations, the investigated cases account for only 17% of all incidents. Moreover, the data provided only shows the municipality where the fire occurred, but omits the exact coordinates of the fire, making it impossible to verify the area and intensity of the fire using satellite images.

It is **important to acknowledge the limitations** of the data provided by Fire Service.

**Power Line Fires**

Another dataset that can be used to analyze fire ignitions is the Fire Service's publicly available data covering all fire incidents over the 5-year period, from 2020 to 2024. This dataset includes **46,456 fire records** for both large and small fires, but it does not specify the ignition source. Coordinates of the occurred fires are only publicly available for this time period.

We mapped these incidents by municipality.

Ignitions 2020-2024 per municipalities

The **highest numbers of ignitions were recorded in following municipalities**:

- Pyrgos: 1,459
- Kalamata: 1,064
- Agrinio: 941
- Messini: 909
- Pella: 870

We mapped these incidents across urban and agricultural areas using land-use data from CORINE Land Cover provided by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service and settlement data from Terra company. **17.3%** of fires occurred in urban and agricultural zones.

Ignitions 2020-2024 in urban and agricultural areas

We also mapped fires in proximity to high-voltage power lines, using power lines data retrieved from OpenStreetMap.

Ignitions 2020-2024 on high-voltage power lines

Out of all fires during this period, **219 ignitions** occurred in close proximity to high-voltage power lines, within a 15 m buffer around the lines. This represents approximately **0.5% of the total number** of cases.

Data on low- and medium-voltage power lines **are not publicly available**; no conclusions can be drawn regarding the actual percentage of fires caused by electricity. However, clear evidence shows that fires do occur there - see the Case Studies section below for details.

**Control over Electricity**

Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in Greece are handled by different entities.

**PPC (ΔΕΗ)** is the largest electricity producer, supplying most power from natural gas and renewables (wind, solar, hydro). Lignite and oil are now minor sources. PPC is no longer fully state-owned - about **35% is held by the Greek state**, with the rest owned by private and institutional investors.

The **transmission system** (high-voltage grid) is managed by **IPTO (ΑΔΜΗΕ)**, which is **state-controlled** through a 51% public shareholding, while the rest is privately held and traded.

The **distribution network** (medium- and low-voltage grid) is operated by **HEDNO (ΔΕΔΔΗΕ)**, **51% owned by PPC** and 49% by private investor, Macquarie Asset Management. HEDNO controls access to local grid data but **does not publicly share detailed maps of medium- and low-voltage lines**, which limits transparency for researchers and local planning.

**Case Studies**

WWF Greece has documented **72 confirmed wildfire cases** caused by power lines for the past 19 years, with precise coordinates of initial ignitions recorded for each incident.

Proven electricity ignitions 2007-2025

Proven electricity ignitions

The data were collected by the WWF Greece team, volunteers, Fire Service personnel willing to unofficially share information, media sources, and other contributors. The dataset covers incidents from 2007 to the present and is continuously updated.

Some fires can be visible on high-voltage power lines. However, the **majority of these ignitions occurred on low- and medium-voltage power lines** for which data are not publicly available.

Data is owned the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator (DEDDHE) and available for the Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection. They do not give public access to it.

We verified the case studies' data using satellite imagery (Harmonized Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A), analyzing pre- and post-fire images to distinguish burned areas and assess the damage caused by wildfires that occurred because of electricity ignitions.

Fire scar - visualisation of dNBR index of fire severity

We detected the fire scar using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) vegetation index and extracted polygons of fire areas.

Eventually, 6 cases were selected, with notable fire history and the presence of visible fire scars.

**01/06**

**1**

**Xylokastro fire, 2018**

Repetitively burned area. Fire spread rapidly due to strong winds - cold front phenomenon - and dry conditions; the fire quickly became uncontrollable and was difficult to suppress because of the hilly area with extensive streams in the region. Two people died in their attempt to save sheep.

**2**

**Loutraki fire, 2019**

Fire-prone touristic area with repetitive burns. Strong winds and wind swirls in the area made the fire uncontrollable; mountainous terrain with sharp slopes and a great amount of forest fuels hindered firefighting.

**3**

**Tatoi fire, 2021**

Fire affected historic areas and forests near urban areas important for the ecological health of Athens. Heatwave and dry conditions fueled the fire; thousands of residents were evacuated and hundreds of houses were destroyed.

**4**

**Glyfada fire, 2022**

Fire-prone areas burn almost every year. In 2022, people were evacuated, houses, cars and other property were burned. Fire was exacerbated by heatwaves and meltemi - strong, dry, seasonal northerly winds in the region.

**5**

**East Attica fire, 2024**

Impacted north-eastern suburbs of Athens. Fire spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions. One person died, 150 houses heavily impacted.

**6**

**Kythira fire, 2025**

Repetitively burned area. Fire fueled by strong winds, high temperatures and dry conditions. Agricultural and forested land were burned, including areas still recovering from 2017 fire. Three villages were evacuated.

The selected case study areas cover a **total of 237 km².**

Areas burned from electricity ignitions of selected case studies

Areas of Tatoi (2021) and East Attica (2024) fires

On the map, the ignition source for the Tatoi fire in 2021 is clearly visible on a high-voltage power line.

In contrast, for the East Attica fire in 2024, although the ignition was confirmed to have originated from a power line, it is not visible on a power line, as it occurred on a low-voltage line for which data are not publicly available.

Area of Kythira island fire (2025)

On many islands, information on low- and medium-voltage power lines is critical for prevention and fire preparedness because of the absence of high-voltage lines.

For instance, on Kythira island, fires occurred repeatedly this year in areas that had also burned in 2017, with both incidents confirmed to have been caused by electricity-related ignitions from low-voltage power lines.

**Proposals**

In collaboration with WWF Greece, we have developed the following recommendations for improving the existing situation:

- **Public acknowledgment and transparency:** officially recognize the problem and publish data related to fires caused by power lines.
- **Digitization of the power grid information**: provide publicly available data on low- and medium-voltage power lines, as it is a matter of public safety, for identifying risks and prevention.
- **Fire risk mapping**: develop fire hazard maps along the power lines using multiple criteria analysis, including fuel type, slope, and fire history.
- **Prioritized fuel and technical management**: focus vegetation management and technical solutions on areas identified as high risk.
- Priority to **risk mitigation in protected areas.**
- **Controlled power outages** when weather conditions pose a high fire risk. Equip networks with remote-controlled isolation devices that can limit the power lines' work at certain sections to improve safety.
- **Strategic goal** to stop building new above-ground power lines in the future.
- **Collaboration** between electricity providers, the Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, Fire and Forest Services, and NGOs can help fire prevention and planning.
